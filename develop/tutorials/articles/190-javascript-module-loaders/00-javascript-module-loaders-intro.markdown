# JavaScript Module Loaders [](id=javascript-module-loaders)

JavaScript modules encapsulate code into useful units that export their
functions. Structuring an application this way makes it easier to work with in
these ways: 

- Other modules can explicitly require this piece of code.
- Structuring an application this way makes it easier to see the broader
  scope.
- Modular applications keep related functionality close together.
- Modularized code makes it easier to find what you're looking for.

These tutorials show you how to use JavaScript libraries not included in
@product@ and how to load modules using AUI.
