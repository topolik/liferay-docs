It's built with 
[Node](https://nodejs.org/) 
and 
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), 
so creating a theme is as easy as answering just a few questions. It also
provides sub-generators for [importing existing SDK
themes](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/migrating-a-6-2-theme-to-liferay-7),
[creating layout
templates](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-layout-templates-with-the-themes-generator),
and [extending your theme with themelets](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/themelets). 
Generated themes have access to several 
[gulp tasks](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/theme-gulp-tasks) that you can
use to further develop and manage your theme. As you can see, the Liferay Theme
Generator is a pretty versatile tool. This section of tutorials shows how to
[install](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-the-theme-generator)
and use the Liferay Theme Generator to [create
themes](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-themes-with-the-liferay-theme-generator).
